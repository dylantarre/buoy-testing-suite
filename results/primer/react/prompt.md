I ran Buoy (a design drift detection tool) on the open source repository **primer/react**.

Please analyze the results and help me understand:
1. Are these drift signals accurate or false positives?
2. What patterns did Buoy miss that it should have caught?
3. How can we improve Buoy's detection for this type of codebase?

## Accuracy Assessment
For each drift signal above, classify it as:
- **True Positive**: Correctly identified actual drift
- **False Positive**: Flagged something that isn't actually a problem
- **Needs Context**: Cannot determine without more information

## Coverage Gaps
Looking at the codebase, what drift patterns exist that Buoy didn't detect?
Consider:
- Hardcoded values that should use design tokens
- Inconsistent naming patterns
- Deprecated patterns still in use
- Components that diverge from design system

## Improvement Suggestions
What specific improvements would make Buoy more effective for this type of codebase?
Consider:
- New drift types to detect
- Better heuristics for existing detections
- Framework-specific patterns to recognize
- False positive reduction strategies
